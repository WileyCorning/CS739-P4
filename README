The project consists of three Rust binaries with a set of shared library code.

To demonstrate the code on your local machine, run `cargo build` to build the executables, and then run `server 0`, `volunteer`, and `client` in separate terminals to exercise the system. To demonstrate the consensus mechanism, run `server 1` to set a fault tolerance of 1, and then at least two volunteers. You can run additional volunteers in slow / malicious mode (`volunteer slow` and `volunteer malicious`) to see the effect of these kinds of issues.
