The project consists of three Rust binaries with a set of shared library code.

To demonstrate the code on your local machine, run `cargo run --bin [server|volunteer|client]`; you will need to run all three simultaneously to observe its behavior.

At time of writing, I'm still working on my evaluation and testing, as well as the report document (Remzi suggested I could take a little extra time for this). If AFS is locked before I finish the report, I will submit it through Canvas. Apologies for the dlay on this. My slides cover the main ideas implemented in this system.
